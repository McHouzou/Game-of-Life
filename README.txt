# Game-of-Life
Game of Life implementation, with animation capabilities. Uses vectorised update function for significant speed-up.

Script "GA_GoL.py", allows for optimization of initial conditions using Genetic Algorithms. Examples of fitness functions, as well as interesting initial conditions discovered using GA are provided in the repo.

Script "Run_GoL.py", contains code to run and visualize given specific initial conditions. Just uncomment the relevant blocks of code (commenting out the rest), and enjoy the visualization!
